title: Running on PlanetScale
---

[PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) is a MySQL-compatible serverless database platform. PlanetScale uses [Vitess](https://vitess.io/) which doesn't support foreign keys and therefore we have to modify `schema.mysql.sql` as explained below.

## Setup

1. Fork the [https://github.com/umami-software/umami](https://github.com/umami-software/umami) project to your GitHub account.
2. Create a database on PlanetScale called `umami-db` and get its connection string (Hint: select "Prisma" from the "Connect with" menu). It should look something like this: `mysql://username:password@host/umami-db?sslaccept=strict`.
3. Add `DATABASE_URL` and `SKIP_DB_CHECK` to your `.env` file:

```
DATABASE_URL=mysql://username:password@host/umami-db?sslaccept=strict
SKIP_DB_CHECK=1
```

5. Download the [PlanetScale CLI](https://github.com/planetscale/cli/releases) and authenticate with `pscale auth login`.
6. Create the tables by running the following command on the root of the project: `pscale shell umami-db main < sql/schema.mysql.sql`.
7. You should now be able to build and start Umami (`yarn build` followed by `yarn start`).
8. Follow the **Getting started** guide starting from the [Login](/docs/login) step and be sure to change the default password.

### Troubleshooting

If are getting an error like the following example:

```
PrismaClientInitializationError: Can't reach database server at `host.aws-region.psdb.cloud`:`3306`
```

You can try add a connection timeout query parameter on your `DATABASE_URL`:

```
DATABASE_URL=mysql://username:password@host/umami-db?sslaccept=strict&connect_timeout=300
```
