## Simple analytics

Umami measures just the important metrics that you care about: pageviews, devices used, and where your visitors
are coming from. Everything is displayed on a single, easy to browse page.

## Unlimited websites

Umami is able to track an unlimited number of websites from a single installation. You can even track subdomains and
individual URLs.

## Bypass ad-blockers

Umami is hosted by you under your own domain so you can reliably avoid ad-blockers unlike Google Analytics.

## Light-weight

The tracking script is tiny (only 2KB) and supports legacy browsers like IE.

## Multiple accounts

Umami can be used to host data for friends or clients. Just create a separate account and they can start tracking their
own websites on their own dashboard.

## Share data

If you want to share your stats publicly, you can do so with a uniquely generated URL.

## Mobile-friendly

The Umami interface has been optimized for mobile so you can view your stats from anywhere.

## Data ownership

Since Umami is self-hosted you own all the data. No need to hand your data to a third party to be exploited.

## Privacy-focused

Umami does not collect any personally identifiable information and anonymizes all data collected.

## Open-source

Umami is open-source and licensed under the MIT license. The source code is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/umami-software/umami).
