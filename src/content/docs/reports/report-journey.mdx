# Journey

Umami Journey provides analytics into optimizing website performance and enhancing user experience. User journeys map out the steps
visitors take to achieve their goals, such as making a purchase or signing up for a newsletter. By analyzing these paths,
you can identify and remove pain points, ultimately leading to improved customer satisfaction.

The report works by displaying the top user journeys for your website. You can traverse each step and explore where users start off, where they drop off,
and where they end up at.

## Parameters

- `Website`: (required) The website you want to run the report on.
- `Date range`: (required) The date range of the report.
- `Steps`: (required) Sequential step conditions used in the user journey. Range is between 3 to 7 steps.
- `Start Step`: The first step of the user journey. Can be an URL or event.
- `End Step`: The last step of the user journey. Can be an URL or event.
