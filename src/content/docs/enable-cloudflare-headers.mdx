title: Enable Cloudflare headers
---

If you are using Cloudflare for your website, Umami will use the headers Cloudflare sends
to determine the visitor's location information. However, by default Cloudflare only sends
data for the country. If you also want region and city information, then you will need to
configure Cloudflare to send additional headers.

## Steps

1. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard and select your account and website.

2.  Go to Rules > Transform Rules.

3.  Go to the Managed Transforms tab.

4. Enable the **Add visitor location headers** setting.
