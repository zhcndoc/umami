Knowing how a user navigates through your product is everything. This information can help optimize conversions, steer your product roadmap, and help inform other key decision-making. The Umami Journey report, one in a suite of product analytics reports, allows product teams to map out and analyze the steps visitors take to achieve their goals, such as purchasing or signing up for a newsletter.

The Journey report enables teams to visualize and analyze user paths through their website or app, identifying popular routes, drop-off points, and opportunities for optimization. By combining this data with insights from other Umami reports like Funnel, Retention, Goals, UTMs, and Insights, product teams can clearly understand their product's performance and user behavior.

This blog post explores key features and use cases of the Umami Journey report.

# Journey Report Key Features

To get the maximum benefit out of the Journey report, it's recommended that you have custom events set up on your product beforehand. Before we jump into the use cases, let's look at some key features of the Journey report:

1. **Flexible Path Analysis**: This method analyzes user journeys with 3 to 7 steps, allowing you to analyze any kind of nuanced journey.
2. **Start and End Step Definition**: Define specific start and end points for user journeys, focusing on particular conversion paths or user flows.
3. **Visual Path Exploration**: The report provides interactive visualizations of user paths, allowing you to review where users start, where they drop off, and where they end up.
4. **Drop-off Analysis**: Easily identify where users leave your desired path, with percentage breakdowns at each step.

# Journey Report Use Cases

This section will cover various use cases that product analytics teams will likely find interesting. There are countless ways to use the Journey report to uncover insights about your users and product. Hopefully, these ideas will help get you started.

## Use Case: Optimizing Onboarding Flow

Product teams need to understand how new users navigate through their onboarding process. Here's how you can use the Journey report for this purpose:

### Setup
1. Define the key steps in your onboarding process.
2. Create a Journey report with these steps, using URLs or events to represent each stage.
3. Set the start step as the initial onboarding page or event and the end step as the completion of onboarding (ideally, also a page or event).

### Analysis Approach

Once you've set up the Journey report, you can analyze the data in several ways:

1. Identify the most common paths users take through onboarding, which might reveal unexpected user behaviors or preferences.
2. Pinpoint where the highest drop-offs occur in the onboarding process, indicating potential pain points or areas of confusion.
3. Compare the paths of users who complete onboarding successfully versus those who don't, to understand what differentiates these groups.
4. Analyze how changes to the onboarding flow impact user paths and completion rates over time.

Using the Journey report in this way can help you optimize your onboarding process, reduce drop-offs, and improve the new user experience.

## Use Case: Conversion Path Analysis

For teams focused on improving conversion rates, the Journey report can help understand the paths leading to conversions. Here's how you might approach this:

### Setup

1. Define the key stages in your conversion process (for example: product page view, add to cart, checkout initiation, purchase completion).
2. Create a Journey report with these stages as steps.
3. Set the start step as a common entry point (e.g., homepage or product listing page) and the end step as the final conversion event.

### Example Implementation

Let's say you're analyzing the conversion path for an e-commerce website. We might set up the following Journey report:

1. Start Step: Homepage URL or 'Session Start' event, or maybe itâ€™s a paid search landing page
2. Intermediate Steps: Product page URL, 'Add to Cart' event, Checkout page URL
3. End Step: 'Purchase Complete' event

Since the journey report allows for up to 7 steps, you should be able to analyze even the most nuanced journeys.

### Analysis Approach

With this Journey report in place, we can:

1. Identify the most common paths that lead to successful conversions.
2. Analyze where potential customers are dropping off in the purchase process.
3. Compare the paths of converting users versus non-converting users to understand key differences.
4. Examine how marketing campaigns or product updates impact user journeys and conversion rates.

Looking at the Journey report regularly can help you optimize your conversion funnel and improve overall conversion rates.

## Use Case: Feature Discovery and Usage Patterns

For teams looking to understand how users discover and engage with key features, the Journey report can help. Here's how you can use it:

### Setup

1. Identify the key features you want to analyze.
2. Create events or use URLs that represent engagement with these features.
3. Set up a Journey report with a broad start point (like the app homepage) and use feature engagement as intermediate or end steps.

### Analysis Approach

Suppose you work at a SaaS company and want to understand how users discover and engage with a new feature. You could use the Journey report to:

1. Analyze the most common paths users take to discover the new feature.
2. Identify which other features or pages often lead users to engage with the collaborative tool.
3. Examine the sequence of actions users typically take after discovering the feature.
4. Compare the journeys of power users versus casual users to understand how feature discovery and usage patterns differ.

This approach lets you make more informed decisions about feature placement, user education/what docs to create, and product layout to encourage feature adoption and engagement.

The Umami Journey report is a great tool for your product analytics capabilities. It allows you to visualize and analyze complex user paths through your product.
