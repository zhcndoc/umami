Reviewing web page insights is critical to understanding your website's performance and the efforts driving traffic. Reports such as page views, bounce rates, and user demographics can give you valuable information about how visitors interact with your site. This data can help you identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions regarding your content strategy, marketing campaigns, online presence, etc.

This blog post reviews the basics of web page Insights and explores how you can use Umami to improve your website's performance and its ability to produce outcomes.

# Visitor Insights and Behavioral Analysis

Is your target audience coming to your website, and what are they doing? Reviewing your web page insights lets you paint a clear picture of the traffic coming to your website and how they interact with your site. For instance, you might identify that most traffic comes from mobile devices. This insight could lead you to prioritize mobile optimization, increasing mobile conversions.

Letâ€™s break down some more visitor insights and behavioral analysis insights that you can learn from your website analytics:

**Visitor Information**: This includes insights into visitors' devices, browsers, operating systems, and locations. By examining this data, you can spot trends and preferences among your audience. For example, if many visitors use desktop devices, you can prioritize desktop optimization to ensure a better user experience for that segment. Similarly, understanding what percentage of traffic is visiting your site with what browser or operating systems allows you to adjust those segments.

**Page Views and Engagement**: Tracking page views helps determine the popularity and effectiveness of your website content. Web analytics provides a clear overview of which pages receive the most traffic, helping you identify your top-performing content, such as blog posts, landing pages, etc. Bounce rate and time on page can add a layer of understanding to how specific content is performing.

A website bounce is a visitor who leaves after looking at just one page of the website. A high bounce rate suggests visitors need help finding what they're looking for or that your content is irrelevant to the traffic. By analyzing bounce rates across different pages and page types (e.g., blogs, landing pages, etc.), you can identify areas that need improvement and take steps to reduce visitor abandonment.

Time on page shows how long visitors spend engaging with your content. Longer durations indicate that your content is valuable and resonates with your audience. Combining page view and engagement data lets you see how website traffic moves around, which you can then use to make informed decisions to optimize their experience.

# Traffic Analysis and Campaign Measurement

Knowing where website traffic comes from is important because it helps you allocate your resources effectively. You need to identify the channels that drive the most visitors to your site and ensure the experience and content are relevant.

**Traffic Sources**: Breaks down your traffic into categories such as organic search, direct traffic, referral traffic, social media, etc. By analyzing the distribution of your traffic sources, you can see which channels are most effective in attracting visitors. This information can guide your future marketing strategies, helping you focus on the channels that yield the best results. Using UTM parameters on your links that drive traffic to your website can help you view and understand traffic sources that you might want to view separately (more on UTMs in a minute).

For example, if organic search is a significant traffic driver, you should invest in search engine optimization (SEO) to improve your website's visibility in search results. If social media is a top referrer, you can allocate more resources to social media marketing and engage with your audience on platforms that generate the most traffic.

**UTM Tracking and Campaign Measurement**: Analyze traffic by adding UTM query parameters to the end of a URL. By appending UTM parameters to your campaign URLs, you can determine which efforts drive traffic to your website, such as email, social media ads, paid ads campaigns, etc., and how they perform on a granular level.

A clear breakdown of your UTM-tagged traffic allows you to assess the success of individual campaigns. You can analyze metrics like click-through, conversion, and revenue generated from each campaign.

# Advanced Insights and Reporting

While basic visitor and traffic data are essential, understanding advanced insights and reporting features can help you improve your website traffic knowledge.

**Custom Events**: Track specific events on your website, such as form submissions, button clicks, or eCommerce purchases. By defining custom events, you can better understand how visitors interact with your site beyond page views.

You can make your custom event tracking more granular by capturing additional data, such as email addresses. Capturing additional properties during custom event tracking allows you to attach additional information to your events, providing more context and enabling deeper analysis.

**Funnels and Retention Analysis**: A funnel report visualizes the journey visitors take through your website toward a desired action, such as purchasing or signing up. By defining funnel steps, you can identify where visitors drop off along the way and pinpoint areas for improvement. Understanding your conversion funnel helps you optimize it for specific channels.

Retention reports measure how often visitors return to your website over time. Understanding visitor retention is crucial for assessing your website's stickiness and long-term engagement. Retention reports show the percentage of visitors who return to your site after their initial visit, segmented by different periods. You can identify strategies to keep visitors returning and build a loyal user base by analyzing retention data.

**Access Controls**: Generate custom reports based on specific websites, date ranges, and metrics. Sharing your reports with team members and key stakeholders, such as executives, is important. Generate a secure, shareable URL that grants access to your reports. This feature streamlines collaboration and informs everyone about your website's performance.

# Privacy and Data Ownership

With increasing data privacy concerns, you need to address data privacy and data protection concerns.

**GDPR and CCPA Compliance**: Umami fully complies with the GDPR and CCPA. PII is not collected from your website visitors, so you can use Umami without violating data privacy regulations.

**Data Anonymization**: Umami anonymizes all collected data to further protect your visitors' privacy. This means individual visitor data is stripped of identifying information, making it impossible to trace back to specific individuals.

**Cookie-Free Tracking**: Umami does not rely on cookies for tracking. This means you don't need to display intrusive cookie consent banners on your website, making for a better user experience.

**Data Ownership and Control**: With Umami, you have complete control over your data. You can self-host the platform on your infrastructure, giving you full ownership and security of your analytics data. Alternatively, if you use Umami Cloud, you can easily export your data anytime, ensuring you always have access to your valuable insights.
