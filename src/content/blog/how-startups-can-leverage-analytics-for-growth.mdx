Umami offers startups a privacy-focused analytics platform that's easy to implement and use. This post explores how Umami's features and
customizable reports are good for startups who need to make quick decisions from their analytics without the over-complexities of
enterprise analytics solutions.

## Core Features

Before diving into advanced reports, let's quickly cover Umami's core features:

- **Real-time data**: Get instant insights into your website's performance, allowing you to react quickly to traffic spikes or sudden changes in user behavior.
- **Visitor information**: Understand your audience with details like their devices, browsers, operating systems, and locations. This data helps you optimize your product for the most common user environments.
- **Page views and bounce rates**: Identify your most popular content and areas for improvement. High bounce rates might indicate misaligned user expectations or usability issues.
- **Traffic sources and referrers**: Discover where your visitors are coming from to optimize your marketing efforts. This information is crucial for allocating your limited marketing budget effectively.
- **Geographical data**: Tailor your strategies based on your users' locations. This can inform decisions about localization, market expansion, or region-specific features.
- **Language preferences**: Ensure your content resonates with your audience's language needs, which is especially important for startups targeting a global market.

These are just some of the [core features](https://umami.is/features) offered by Umami which provide a solid foundation for understanding your startup's online presence. The real magic of Umami is its reports, which can be fully customized to your unique needs.

## Reports

One of the main benefits of Umami is the customizable reports. For startups, this means building the exact report you need to quickly get the data you need.

### Insights Report

The Insights report allows you to dive deep into your data using segments and filters. It provides a breakdown of metrics like visitors, views,
bounce rate, and visit duration based on various fields such as URL, referrer, device, and location. You can use this report to analyze user
behavior, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to improve product or marketing strategies.

To dive deeper into the capabilities of this report, check out our blog post, [Understanding the Insights Report](https://umami.is/blog/understanding-the-insights-report) or the Insights Report [documentation](https://umami.is/docs/reports/report-insights).

### Funnel Report

The Funnel report helps you understand the conversion and drop-off rates of users through specific paths on your website or product. It displays
the counts of users that reach each URL or event and the drop-off rate from the previous step. This report can help optimize user flows,
improve onboarding processes, and increase conversion rates by identifying and addressing bottlenecks in the user journey.

For tips on leveraging this report, read our blog post, [Optimizing Conversion Paths Using the Funnel Report](https://umami.is/blog/optimizing-conversion-paths-using-the-funnel-report), or refer to the Funnel Report [documentation](https://umami.is/docs/reports/report-funnel).

### Retention Report

The Retention report measures how often users return by using a cohort analysis chart to show insights into long-term retention trends and the performance of distinct user groups. You can leverage this report to understand and improve user loyalty, assess the effectiveness of engagement strategies, and identify factors that contribute to higher retention rates.

Gain more insights on retention analysis from our article Understanding Retention Analysis or the Retention Report Documentation.

### UTM Report

The UTM report provides analytics on the performance of marketing campaigns by tracking UTM parameters in URLs. Links with UTMs can be used outside of marketing campaigns (in product, for example), so this report can flex beyond a marketing use case.

UTM parameters on your URLs are automatically ingested into the report and it covers all of them: source, medium, campaign, term, and content. This report helps evaluate the effectiveness of different marketing channels, optimize marketing spend, and understand which campaigns are driving the traffic and conversions.

### Goals Report

The Goals report allows you to track progress toward specific objectives. It supports goals based on URLs, events, and event data properties, providing a visual representation of goal completion. Use this report to set and monitor KPIs, measure the success of product features or marketing initiatives, and align team efforts toward common objectives.

### Journey Report

The Journey report shows how users navigate through your website or product. It displays the top user journeys and allows exploration of each step, showing where users start, where they drop off, and where they end up. This report can be used to optimize website structure, improve user experience, and identify popular paths to conversion or key actions within the product.

## Custom Events

Custom events allow you to [track events](https://umami.is/docs/track-events) specific to your startup's unique needs. Custom events can be set up using either data attributes or JavaScript. For instance, you could track when a user clicks a signup button or when they start a subscription, including additional data like the plan type or whether it's an annual subscription.

Implementing custom events on your website or product is really important in order to fully leverage Umami and all of its reports.

Startup-specific custom events might include tracking feature usage (e.g., "AI assistant used," "Report exported"), user milestones (e.g., "First project created," "Team member invited"), or engagement actions (e.g., "Blog comment posted," "Product review submitted"). By combining these custom events with Umami's built-in reports, you can gain deeper insights into user behavior and product performance.
