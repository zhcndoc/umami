Umami v2.13.0 is here! This update introduces two new screens called Events and Sessions, the ability to save session data, session profiles, bug fixes, language updates, and more. All the details are right here:

# New Events screen

The Events screen quickly summarizes all of the custom events being recorded for a timeframe you define. It goes without saying that using custom events is a requirement for this screen. Here are some key features of the new Events screen:

- **Centralized Event Information**: We've moved the events chart and metrics table from the overview screen to this dedicated space, making it easier to focus on event-specific data.
- **Activity Stream**: Scrolling down from the Events screen (on the same screen) is a table that displays all your event activity, complete with visitor avatars. This visual representation helps you quickly identify who's (although anonymized) performing specific events.
- **Streamlined Custom Data Access**: The old event data screen has been deprecated. Now, you can access all your custom data under the "Properties" tab on the events screen. This section provides a breakdown of all custom data properties and their values.
- **Enhanced Visibility**: With this new layout, you can more easily track and analyze the performance of your custom events, leading to more informed decision-making.

# New Sessions screen

The new Sessions screen summarizes session data. First, there is a weekly breakdown of session data by day and hour. Visual aids (blue circles) help you see which days/hours have a high number of sessions (indicated by a larger blue circle) or a low number of sessions (indicated by a smaller blue circle).
Here are some key features of the new Sessions screen:
Hourly Traffic Breakdown: Shows you an hourly traffic breakdown during a week. This feature lets you identify your website or appâ€™s busiest times, helping you optimize content delivery and server resources.

## Visitor Profiles

Clicking on any avatar in the activity stream just below the screen brings up a new page showing details about that particular visitor, including their activity history over time.

# Save Session Data

We're introducing support for saving session data. This feature works similarly to custom event data and opens up new possibilities for user tracking and analysis:
Easy Implementation: Use the identify function from the tracker script to save data about the current session. Saved session data will appear in the new session profile page under Properties.

For example:

```javascript
umami.identify({ email: 'bob@aol.com' });
```
