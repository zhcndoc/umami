Your analytics needs evolve as your startup grows from early stage to growth stage to series B and beyond. What worked in the early days might not cut it as you scale. Umami was built with startups in mind and can cover your changing analytics needs as you scale and grow your startup.

# Early Stage (MVP/Pre-seed)

In the early days, you're in a phase of discovery and validation with a focus on proving that your idea has merit and that there is product market fit. You're likely working with an MVP and a small but growing user base. That's where analytics comes in – not as a complex system of metrics and dashboards but as a simple tool to validate your assumptions and guide your next steps.

Your analytics should focus on three primary areas: user acquisition, retention, and engagement.

User acquisition metrics help you understand how you attract users to your product. This could be as simple as tracking the number of sign-ups or downloads. But it's not just about the numbers – you also want to know where these users come from. Are they finding you through word of mouth, social media, search engines, etc. This helps you focus your limited marketing resources on the most effective channels.

Retention is arguably even more important than acquisition at this stage. It's one thing to get users to try your product, but are they finding enough value to come back?

Engagement metrics show what features they are using and how long they spend in your app or on your site. Engagement metrics can guide your product roadmap and give you focus on the features that provide the most value.

At this stage of your analytics journey, you don't really need anything too complex, just the basics. A solution like [GA4 might be overly complex](https://umami.is/blog/analytics-for-startups) for this stage and not be a good fit.

## Leveraging Umami Reports:

1. **UTM Report**: Track the effectiveness of your initial marketing efforts. Use UTM parameters in your links to understand which channels and content (social media, email, etc.) drive the most traffic to your site.
2. **Funnel Report**: Set up a basic funnel to track your sign-up or onboarding process. This will help you identify where potential users are dropping off.
3. **Journey Report**: Use this to understand the most common paths users take through your product and website. This can help you identify which features are most used and which might need improvement.
4. **Insights Report**: Get a quick overview of your visitors, views, and top pages. Use this to understand your overall user acquisition and engagement.
5. **Goals Report**: Setup simple goals like "completed sign-up" or "used key feature" or “visited pricing page” to track your most important conversion metrics and page views.
6. **Retention Report**: Use this to see how many return to your product over time via cohort analysis.

# Growth Stage (Seed/Series A)

At the growth stage, you're likely dealing with a larger and more diverse user base, more complex product features, and increased competition. You're likely no longer just concerned with whether people are using your product (although to some extent this will always be top of mind!) but how they're using it and how you can optimize their experience.

## Key Metrics to Track:

While you'll continue to track the basic metrics from the early stage, you'll also need to go into more detailed user behavior analysis, conversion funnel optimization, and customer segmentation.

Detailed user behavior analysis goes beyond simple engagement metrics. You want to understand the full user journey within your product. What paths do users typically take? Where do they spend the most time? Where do they get stuck or drop off? This level of analysis can reveal opportunities for improving your user experience, streamlining your product, and identifying features that might be underutilized or confusing to users.

Conversion funnel optimization becomes important. You need to understand how many users you're acquiring and how efficiently you're converting them into active, paying customers. This involves mapping out your entire conversion process – from initial awareness through to paid conversion and beyond – and identifying bottlenecks or drop-off points. By optimizing each step of this funnel, you can dramatically improve your growth rate and customer acquisition costs.

Customer segmentation is about understanding that not all users are the same. As your user base grows, you'll likely find that different types of users interact with your product in different ways. They may have different needs, behaviors, and values for your business. By segmenting users based on characteristics like behavior, demographics, or customer lifecycle stage, you can tailor your product development and marketing efforts to serve each group better. This can improve retention, higher customer lifetime value, and more efficient growth.

At this stage, your analytics should provide actionable insights that directly inform your product, marketing, and business strategies. You're looking for data that can help you decide on feature prioritization, marketing channel optimization, pricing strategies, and more.

## Leveraging Umami Reports:

1. **UTM Report**: As you expand your marketing efforts, use this report to compare the performance of different campaigns and channels.
2. **Funnel Report**: Create more complex funnels for key user journeys (like the sign-up process or purchase flow) to identify and address drop-off points, optimizing your conversion rates.
3. **Journey Report**: Analyze the most common user paths in more detail. Use this information to optimize your user experience and identify features that might benefit from further development.
4. **Insights Report**: Utilize the advanced filtering options to segment your users based on various criteria (location, device, etc.), helping you understand different user types and their behaviors.
5. **Goals Report**: Set more nuanced goals to track specific user actions or milestones within your product. This can help you measure product adoption and feature usage.
6. **Retention Report**: Dive deeper into cohort analysis to understand how your retention rates change over time and for different user segments. This can inform your product development and customer success strategies.

# Scaling Stage (Series B and beyond)

The scaling stage is where your startup transitions into a more mature company. You've proven your business model, achieved growth, and are focused on maintaining and accelerating that growth while building a sustainable, profitable business. This stage brings new challenges: dealing with a large and diverse user base, complex operations, and possibly expanding into new markets or product lines.

Now, you're not just looking at what's happening but also trying to predict future trends and behaviors. You need analytics that can handle large volumes of data, provide deep insights, and support decision-making across multiple teams and departments.

## Key Metrics to Track:

In the scaling stage, your analytics capabilities need to expand to keep pace with your growing business. While you'll continue to track and refine the metrics from earlier stages, you'll also need to focus on advanced custom reporting and dashboards.

Custom reporting and dashboards become essential as your company grows and becomes more complex. Different teams and stakeholders will need access to different data and insights. Your analytics should be able to provide tailored dashboards for marketing, product, customer success, finance, sales, executive teams, and more. These dashboards should offer high-level overviews for quick decision-making and the ability to dive deep into the data when needed.

Your analytics should be deeply integrated into your business processes, providing real-time insights that drive decision-making at all levels of the organization. You're not just tracking metrics – you're using data to uncover new opportunities, optimize every aspect of your business, and drive sustainable growth.

## Leveraging Umami Reports:

1. **UTM Report**: Use this to analyze the performance of multiple, complex marketing campaigns across various channels. This can inform your broader marketing strategy and budget allocation.
2. **Funnel Report**: Create and analyze multiple funnels for different user segments or product features. Use this data to optimize user experience and increase conversions.
3. **Journey Report**: Combine journey analysis with other data points for a holistic view of user behavior. This can inform product development, personalization efforts, and customer success strategies.
4. **Insights Report**: Filtering and segmentation capabilities can perform deep-dive analysis on specific user segments or behaviors.
5. **Goals Report**: Set complex, multi-step goals to track advanced user behaviors and conversions.
6. **Retention Report**: Use cohort analysis to understand long-term user behavior patterns and how they change over time. This can inform your long-term product strategy and customer retention efforts.
