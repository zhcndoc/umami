The Lean Startup methodology, which can roughly be described as a Build-Measure-Learn-Adjust feedback loop, can help founder/CEOs and their startups to effectively measure and learn without getting bogged down in complex analytics tools.

Umami Analytics supports startups with its suite of custom reports at each stage of this loop. This article breaks down each stage of the Lean Startup methodology and how founder/CEOs can use Umami reports to help.

## Build

Before you can measure anything, you need to set up your analytics. Assuming you don’t already have Umami, here’s how to get it installed (Umami can be installed on both your marketing website and app):

1. [Sign up](https://cloud.umami.is/signup?ref=umami-blog) for an Umami account
2. Add your website
3. Copy the tracking code
4. Paste the code between the &lt;head&gt; tags of your website

That's it! Umami starts collecting data immediately. This simplicity aligns perfectly with the Lean Startup principle of moving quickly and focusing on what matters most.

Next, define the key events and metrics you want to track. These might include:

- Sign-ups
- Product activations
- Key feature usage
- Purchases or upgrades

With Umami's [custom event tracking](https://umami.is/docs/track-events), you can easily set up these events to measure what matters most to your startup.

You’ve done the hard part by building your product; now let us help with the analytics!

## Measure

Once your product is live and Umami is set up, it's time to start measuring. Umami offers a range of reports that you can customize to help you collect data about your users and their behaviors:

### Funnel Report

The Funnel Report tracks user progression through critical paths. It allows you to visualize and quantify how users move through a series of steps, identifying where they drop off. Set up funnels for processes like:

- User acquisition (from landing page visit to sign-up)
- Onboarding (from sign-up to key action completion)
- Conversion (from product usage to purchase)
- Feature adoption (from feature discovery to regular usage)

For more ideas on the Funnel Report, read our blog post titled, [Optimizing Conversion Paths Using the Funnel Report](https://umami.is/blog/optimizing-conversion-paths-using-the-funnel-report).

### Retention Report

The Retention Report is crucial for measuring how well you're retaining users over time. It helps you understand:

- Short-term engagement (Are users coming back the next day?)
- Long-term retention (Are users still active after a month?)
- Cohort performance (Are newer user cohorts retaining better than older ones?)
- Impact of product changes on retention (Do specific features improve user retention?)

Our blog post, [Understanding Retention Analysis](https://umami.is/blog/understanding-retention-analysis), jumps into even more ways to use this report.

### Journey Report

The Journey Report provides insights into the paths users take through your product. It helps you identify:

- Popular routes to key actions
- Unexpected user behaviors
- Potential roadblocks in the user experience
- Common entry and exit points

### Goals Report

The Goals Report allows you to set and track progress towards specific metrics or milestones that are important to your business. You can:

- Set targets for key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Track progress over time
- Compare performance across different segments or time periods
- Receive alerts when goals are met or missed

- Understand how different user groups interact with your product

We break down the Insights Report further in our blog post titled [Understanding the Insights Report](https://umami.is/blog/understanding-the-insights-report).

### UTM Report

The UTM Report allows you to track the performance of your efforts across different channels. It helps you:

- Measure traffic from various sources (social media, email, ads, etc.)
- Compare conversion rates across different campaigns
- Understand which marketing efforts drive the most valuable users
  \*Optimize your marketing spend based on performance data

## Learn

Collecting data is only half the battle. The real value comes from analyzing this data to extract actionable insights. Here's how Product teams, Marketing teams, and Founders/CEOs can learn from each of Umami's reports.

Keep in mind these are just a few use cases for product, marketing, and Founder/CEOs. Umami is flexible enough to adapt to the nuances of your specific situation and can be used for each of your teams.

### Funnel Report

Umami Funnel helps you understand the conversion and drop-off rate of users.

**Product Team Use Case:**

- Identify drop-off points in the onboarding process to improve user activation rates. For example, if there's a significant drop between email verification and first login, you might simplify the verification process or provide clearer instructions.
- Analyze how changes to the product interface affect user progression through key workflows. If you've redesigned your checkout process, compare the new funnel performance to the old one to quantify the improvement.

**Marketing Team Use Case:**

- Evaluate the effectiveness of different landing pages by comparing sign-up funnel completion rates. This can help optimize copywriting, design, and call-to-action placement for better conversion.
- Optimize email campaigns by tracking how many users progress from email click to desired action. Use this data to refine email content, timing, and frequency for maximum impact.

**Founder/CEO Use Case:**

- Assess the overall health of the business by monitoring conversion rates at critical stages, such as from free trial to paid subscription. This can provide early warning signs of potential issues in the business model or product-market fit.
- Identify bottlenecks in the customer journey that may require cross-functional solutions, helping to prioritize resources and align team efforts.

### Retention Report

Umami Retention measures your website stickiness by tracking how often users return.

**Product Team Use Case:**

- Determine if new features are improving long-term user engagement by comparing retention rates before and after feature launches. This can help prioritize future feature development based on actual user behavior.

**Marketing Team Use Case:**

- Compare retention rates of users acquired from different marketing channels to focus on high-quality user acquisition sources. This can inform budget allocation across channels for maximum ROI.
- Analyze how different onboarding email sequences affect user retention to optimize communication strategies. Test various email cadences and content to see which leads to better long-term engagement.

**Founder/CEO Use Case:**

- Evaluate product-market fit by examining long-term retention trends. Improving retention rates over time can indicate growing product-market fit, while declining retention might signal the need for strategic pivots.
- Assess the long-term value of customer cohorts to inform financial projections and growth strategies. This can help in making decisions about scaling marketing efforts or raising additional funding.

### Journey Report

Umami Journey provides analytics into optimizing website performance and enhancing user experience.

**Product Team Use Case:**

- Discover user behaviors or popular feature combinations to inform product development priorities. You might find users often use two features in tandem that you hadn't anticipated, suggesting an opportunity for deeper integration.

- Identify common paths that lead to user churn and redesign those experiences to improve retention. If many users drop off after visiting the pricing page, you might need to reconsider your pricing strategy or improve its communication.

### Marketing Team Use Case:

- Understand which content pages often lead to conversions and create similar content. If blog posts on a particular topic frequently lead to sign-ups, it might guide your content marketing strategy.
- Analyze user journeys from different entry points to tailor marketing messages for each traffic source. Users coming from a technical forum might respond better to different messaging than those from a social media post.

### Founder/CEO Use Case:

- Identify potential new revenue streams or product opportunities by understanding common user journeys and unmet needs. This can inform strategic decisions about product expansion or pivot opportunities.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of the current product strategy by analyzing whether users are engaging with key features in the intended sequence. This can help in refining the overall product vision and roadmap.

### Goals Report

Umami Goals provides insights into how well your website is meeting its objectives.

**Product Team Use Case:**

- Track progress towards product adoption milestones (e.g., percentage of users using a new feature) to gauge feature success. This can help determine when a feature has gained enough traction to be considered fully launched.
- Monitor user engagement goals (e.g., daily active users) to assess overall product health. Sudden drops might indicate issues that need immediate attention, while steady growth validates your product strategy.

**Marketing Team Use Case:**

- Measure progress towards acquisition targets for different user segments to guide marketing efforts. If you're falling short on enterprise customer acquisitions, it might signal a need to adjust your B2B marketing strategy.
- Track conversion rate goals for key actions (e.g., free trial to paid conversion) to assess and improve funnel effectiveness. This can help identify when it's time to optimize your pricing page or adjust your sales approach.

**Founder/CEO Use Case:**

- Use goal completion rates to assess team performance and align incentives across the organization. This can help in setting realistic targets and fostering a data-driven culture throughout the company.

### Insights Report

Umami Insights allows you to aggregrate and view your data in a variety of ways. Explore your data more extensively through the utilization of segments and filters.

**Product Team Use Case:**

- Compare feature usage between power users and casual users to identify opportunities for improving user activation. Features that are heavily used by power users but overlooked by casual users might benefit from better onboarding or UI placement.

**Marketing Team Use Case:**

- Identify characteristics of high-value customers to create more targeted acquisition campaigns.

**Founder/CEO Use Case:**

- Understand the characteristics of your most valuable customer segments to inform high-level strategy decisions, such as which markets to expand into or which partnerships to pursue.
- Identify emerging trends or shifts in user behavior that could signal new opportunities or threats to the business, allowing for proactive strategic planning.

### UTM Report

Umami UTM provides analytics on the performance of marketing campaigns by tracking the effectiveness of different marketing channels, such as social media, email, and advertising.

**Product Team Use Case:**

- Analyze which traffic sources bring in users who engage most with key product features to inform product-marketing alignment. This can help tailor product development to best serve your most engaged user segments.
- Compare product usage patterns between users acquired through different campaigns to tailor onboarding experiences. Users from a technical blog post might benefit from a different onboarding flow than those from a general awareness campaign.

**Marketing Team Use Case:**

- Evaluate the performance of different marketing channels in terms of traffic volume and conversion rates. This data can inform budget allocation and help focus efforts on the most effective channels.
- Analyze the impact of various campaign messages or creatives on user acquisition and engagement metrics. Use this information to refine your messaging and creative strategy for future campaigns.

**Founder/CEO Use Case:**

- Identify which marketing narratives and value propositions resonate most with high-value customers, providing insights that can shape overall brand positioning and company messaging.

### A/B Testing

Umami can support A/B testing, allowing you to experiment and adjust rapidly:

1. Create two versions of a page or feature
2. Set up custom events for each version
3. Use Umami's URL filtering to compare performance
4. Implement the winning version and repeat the process

For instance, test different onboarding flows and use Funnel Report data to see which results in better activation rates.

## Adjust

The final step in the Lean Startup cycle is to adjust based on what you've learned. Umami's insights can inform various types of adjustments. The below adjustments are just a few ideas and we hope they get you thinking about ways to improve your product.

They key thing to remember is that Umami can help facilitate the lean startup process and is purpose-built to quickly gather information and make adjustments.

### Product Iterations

Use Funnel and Journey Report insights to identify areas for product improvement. For example: simplify steps where many users drop off in your funnel, enhance discoverability of features that users find valuable, or address common points of confusion revealed in user journeys

### Marketing Optimizations

Leverage UTM Report data to refine your marketing strategy to allocate more budget to high-performing channels, adjust messaging based on what resonates with your audience, and focus on channels that bring in high-quality, retaining users.

### Strategic Pivots

Sometimes, the data might indicate a need for more significant changes. Use Retention Report data to inform pivots if retention is consistently low, you might need to pivot your core value proposition, if certain user segments retain much better than others, and consider pivoting to focus more on those segments.
