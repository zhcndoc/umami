Like many other Google products, Google Analytics has long been the default choice for website analytics.
However, concerns about data privacy, data ownership, [and more](https://umami.is/blog/umami-the-better-google-analytics-alternative) have led many to seek open-source alternatives.

Enter Umami. Umami is a simple, easy-to-use, open-source web analytics alternative to Google Analytics. The goal is to provide a friendlier, privacy-focused alternative to Google Analytics and a free, open-source alternative to paid solutions. Umami only collects the metrics website owners care about and respects the privacy of users.

## Github Superstar

Umami’s entire codebase is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/umami-software/umami), allowing for transparency in how the
tool collects and processes data. This openness builds trust and enables a collaborative development model. Developers from
around the world contribute to Umami, suggesting improvements, fixing bugs, and adding new features.

As of this writing, Umami has over 22K stars on Github, which makes it one of the most popular and fastest-growing open-source
analytics projects.

GitHub is the central hub for Umami's development, where users can find the latest releases, report issues, and participate
in discussions about the tool's future direction. However, Umami’s website hosts its [documentation](https://umami.is/docs).

As an open-source project, anyone can audit the codebase for themselves. This is important for individuals and organizations with stringent security requirements or those operating in regulated industries.

The open-source nature of Umami allows for extensive customization. Users with specific needs can fork the repository and modify the code to suit their unique requirements. This flexibility is important for businesses that find off-the-shelf solutions lacking in certain areas.

Umami is free to self-host, and users have complete control over their data, addressing concerns about data ownership that often arise with third-party analytics services like Google Analytics. The self-hosting option is good for those with the technical know-how and resources to manage their own infrastructure, as it provides maximum control and potential cost savings.

A cloud option is available for those without a technical background or resources to manage their own self-hosted version of Umami. The cloud option has a free tier allowing you to test it out and a generous paid tier available to help users scale.

## Umami’s Capabilities

Beyond all the [standard analytics tracking](https://umami.is/features) capabilities, Umami
offers [custom event tracking](https://umami.is/docs/track-events). This feature allows website owners to track specific user
interactions such as button clicks, form sign-ups, purchases, etc. A guide on implementing custom event tracking is available in
Umami's event tracking documentation. For additional reading, we recently wrote a blog post comparing the custom event functionality of
GA4 and Umami: [Understanding Custom Events - Umami vs. Google Analytics 4](https://umami.is/blog/understanding-custom-events-umami-vs-ga4)

[Privacy](https://umami.is/blog/why-privacy-matters) is at the core of Umami's philosophy. Umami doesn’t use cookies and doesn't collect personal information, ensuring compliance with
[GDPR](https://umami.is/blog/gdpr-compliant-website-analytics) and other privacy regulations out of the box. This approach eliminates the need
for cookie consent popups and simplifies [compliance with data protection laws](https://umami.is/blog/navigating-gdpr-and-ccpa-compliance).

One of Umami’s best features is it’s customizable reports:

* The Funnel Report helps analyze user paths and optimize conversion rates.
* The Retention Report visualizes user return rates and engagement over time.
* The Goals Report allows progress towards key objectives to be set and tracked.
* The UTM Report measures the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.
* The Insights Report provides advanced data segmentation capabilities.
* The Journey Report helps visualize and optimize user journeys through the site.

Since this post is about Umami being open-source, we won’t go into any additional details on these reports. However,
we have a lot of resources for you to explore and learn more about them. We have [documentation available](https://umami.is/docs/reports) for each report and blog posts on each, exploring the reports and use cases in detail.

Umami is a privacy-focused, open-source alternative to GA4 (Google Analytics), providing insights while prioritizing user privacy and data ownership. Its open-source nature offers transparency, customization options, and community-driven development.

Those interested in trying Umami can sign up for an Umami Cloud or explore the [GitHub repository for the self-hosted version](https://github.com/umami-software/website). The Umami support team can be reached at support@umami.is for any questions or assistance.
