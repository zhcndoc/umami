Umami v2.16.0 is here! This update introduces two new metrics section to help you better understand where your visitors are coming from.

## Traffic Channels

We added a new view called Channels which shows you how your traffic is divided up. This is also where you can see your direct traffic (no referrer).

## Grouped Referrers

There is also a new view for seeing grouped referrers. So domains like google.com, google.es, google.co.uk all get grouped under the category Google.

## Ignore URL hashes

If you don't want to track hash values in the URL, you can now set an attribute on the tracker tag, `data-exclude-hash=true`.
