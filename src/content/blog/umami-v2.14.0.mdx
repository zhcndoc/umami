Umami v2.14.0 is here! Introducing a new revenue report, improved dashboard and more.

## Features

### Revenue report

We added a new report that allows you to track revenue. Simply send a custom event with revenue data and it will start tracking. [Learn more](https://umami.is/docs/reports/report-revenue).

### Improved dashboard

In the dashboard, you are now able to select which websites you want to appear, not just the order. Simply toggle the ones you want visible and the rest will be hidden. If none are toggled then all the websites will appear just like before. We also fixed an issue where you couldn't see all your websites if you had too many. Additionally you can now search for websites on the dashboard edit screen.

### Hash based routing support

We now record hashes in URLs for websites that use hashed based routing.

### Redirect to team

Umami now redirects to your last selected team on login.
