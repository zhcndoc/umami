Marketers want website analytics solutions that balance user privacy with getting the data they need to make decisions. While Google Analytics has been a default choice for some time, marketers are now transitioning to a new website analytics provider: Umami. Umami stands out because of its privacy-focused, user-friendly, and cookie-free approach to website analytics.
This guide is your roadmap to successfully transitioning from GA4 to Umami. By following this guide, you'll smoothly transition to Umami, ensuring continued data-driven decision-making power and improved marketing performance while respecting user privacy.

## Section 1: Umami's Benefits for Marketers

In this section of the guide, we will explore Umami's key benefits so marketers can quickly and easily share the rationale behind moving to Umami with colleagues. Colleagues will ask, “Why are we shifting away from GA4 to Umami?” and this section will provide the answer.
We'll discuss how Umami prioritizes privacy, provides a user-friendly dashboard, delivers real-time data, simplifies implementation without the need for Google Tag Manager, and ensures cookie-free tracking.

### Privacy-Focused Analytics

Umami is a privacy-focused, cookie-free alternative to GA4. By default, It is GDPR and CCPA-compliant.

Umami's privacy-focused analytics offer a more ethical approach to website analytics.

Umami ensures compliance with data regulations and respects user privacy, providing a secure and respectful environment for your marketing analytics.

For more information on how GA4 violates user privacy, read our blog post titled [Umami - The Better Google Analytics Alternative](https://umami.zhcndoc.com/blog/umami-the-better-google-analytics-alternative).

### User-Friendly Dashboard

Umami offers an intuitive and clean dashboard interface that surfaces key metrics in a single view, unlike GA4's endless drop-downs and sub-drop-downs.

Umami's dashboard is designed with marketers in mind, which means finding key data fast.

### Real-Time Data

Umami provides real-time data updates, allowing marketers to monitor website performance instantly.

Quick access to real-time data enables timely decision-making and optimizations.

### No Need for Google Tag Manager

Install Umami's tracking code directly into your website's HTML with a single line of code. The Umami script is very lightweight, ensuring website speed and performance.

There's no need to use complicated tools like Google Tag Manager, simplifying the implementation process.

Adding event tracking requires only a basic source-code modification to the object you want to track.

### Cookie-Free Tracking

Umami doesn't use cookies for tracking, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.

You can remove opt-in cookie banners from your website, providing a cleaner user experience.

## Section 2: Setting Up Umami

This section will guide you through setting up your Umami account. We'll cover creating an account and configuring the necessary settings to align with your marketing goals.

### Create an Umami Account

- [Sign up for an account](https://cloud.umami.is/signup?ref=umami-blog).
- [Choose a plan](https://umami.zhcndoc.com/pricing) that suits your website's traffic and marketing needs. Note that Umami is usage-based pricing based on events. When the word events is referenced in pricing, it means website visitors and custom events. For example, if you have ten website visitors who take ten actions tracked by custom events (i.e., button clicks, form submissions, etc.), that counts as 20 total events towards your monthly limit.

### Configure Umami Settings

- Setting up Umami is straightforward. Start by [adding your website](https://umami.zhcndoc.com/docs/add-a-website) to the Umami dashboard.

## Section 3: Implementing Umami

In this part of the guide, we will walk you through the steps to implement Umami tracking on your website. We'll cover obtaining the tracking code, installing it on your website, verifying the implementation, and removing cookie banners.

### Obtain Tracking Code

- In your Umami account, locate the tracking code snippet.
- Copy the tracking code.

### Install Tracking Code on Your Website

- Open your website's source code.
- [Paste the Umami tracking code](https://umami.zhcndoc.com/docs/collect-data) into your website's HTML's &lt;head&gt; section.
- Ensure the tracking code is present on all pages you want to track.

### Verify Tracking Implementation

- Visit your website and navigate through a few pages.
- Check your Umami dashboard to confirm data is being collected accurately.

### Remove Cookie Banners

- Since Umami doesn't use cookies, you can remove any existing opt-in cookie banners from your website after you’ve removed the GA4 script. However, you might still have other tracking codes for other purposes, that you might need the cookie banner for. As far as Umami goes, you don’t need it.
- This provides a cleaner and more streamlined user experience for your visitors.

## Section 4: Running Umami Alongside GA4

Umami can be installed alongside GA4 to ensure a transition period between the two. To confirm, you don’t have to switch off GA4 until you are 100% confident.

## Section 5: Tracking Metrics and Custom Events

This section will explore how to track key marketing metrics and custom events using Umami. We'll set up custom event tracking and monitor the performance of your marketing campaigns.

### Standard Website Metrics

- Umami automatically tracks standard website metrics, such as page views, unique visitors, bounce rate, devices, browsers, locations, etc. Similar to GA4, you do not need to do anything to turn on standard website metrics; they are automatically on.

### Set Up Custom Event Tracking
