Umami v2.15.0 is here! Improvements to the funnel report, bugfixes and more.

## Features

The funnel report now allows partial matching for URLs. You can add `*` to the start and/or end of the text. In this example, we're seeing if users triggered ANY event with "button" in the name.

You can now properly search on city, region and country names. Before you had to lookup by ISO codes because that is what is stored in the database.

It even works with localized names.
