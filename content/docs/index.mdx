Umami is an open-source web analytics platform that respects user privacy. No cookies, no tracking across sites, no personal data collection. GDPR compliant out of the box.

These docs cover **Umami v3**. For the previous version, see the [v2 documentation](https://v2.umami.is).

## Why Umami?

- **Privacy-first** — No cookies, no fingerprinting, no personal data. Your visitors stay anonymous.
- **Own your data** — Self-host on your infrastructure. Your analytics data never leaves your servers.
- **Lightweight** — The tracking script is under 2KB. It won't slow down your site.
- **Simple** — Deploy with Docker in minutes. No complex configuration required.

## Get started

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

That's it. Open `http://localhost:3000` and log in with `admin` / `umami`.

For detailed setup options, see [Installation](/docs/install). For managed hosting platforms, check out our [deployment guides](/docs/guides/hosting).

## Features

**Core analytics** — Pageviews, visitors, bounce rate, session duration, referrers, browsers, operating systems, devices, and countries.

**Custom events** — Track button clicks, form submissions, or any user interaction with a simple data attribute or JavaScript call.

**Advanced insights** — Funnels, user journeys, retention analysis, goals, UTM campaign tracking, and cohort breakdowns.

**Sessions** — View individual visitor activity and session properties without identifying personal information.

**Teams** — Collaborate with your team. Share websites, assign roles, and manage access.

**API** — Full REST API for programmatic access to all your analytics data.
