Umami is an open-source web analytics platform that respects user privacy. No cookies, no tracking across sites, no personal data collection. GDPR compliant out of the box.

## Why Umami?

- **Privacy-first** — No cookies, no fingerprinting, no personal data. Your visitors stay anonymous.
- **Own your data** — Self-host on your infrastructure. Your analytics data never leaves your servers.
- **Lightweight** — The tracking script is under 2KB. It won't slow down your site.
- **Simple** — Deploy with Docker in minutes. No complex configuration required.

## Get started

```bash
docker compose up -d
