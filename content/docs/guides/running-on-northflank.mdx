title: Running on Northflank
---

[Northflank](https://northflank.com) is a fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling applications using containers. It combines the flexibility of cloud infrastructure with a simple developer experience so you can focus on your app instead of managing servers.

Northflank provides free and paid hosting plans that let you deploy Umami together with a managed PostgreSQL database, all configured automatically.

## Setup Website and Database

### Northflank Button (Recommended)

[![Deploy on Northflank](https://assets.northflank.com/deploy_to_northflank_smm_36700fb050.svg)](https://northflank.com/stacks/deploy-umami)

Click the button above to deploy your own Umami instance with a managed PostgreSQL addon and all environment variables preconfigured.

Once the stack is deployed, go to your Umami service in the Northflank project dashboard and open the public URL.  

You should see the setup screen where you can create your admin account and start using Umami.

## Running on Northflank manually

The one-click deployment is the easiest way to get started, but you can also deploy Umami manually using the template configuration.

1. Create a new project on [Northflank](https://northflank.com).
2. Add a **PostgreSQL addon** to the project.
3. Create a **Deployment service** using the Docker image `umamisoftware/umami:postgresql-latest`.
4. Expose port `3000` publicly.
5. Add the following environment variables and link them to your database:
   - `DATABASE_URL` — connection string from the PostgreSQL addon  
   - `DATABASE_TYPE=postgres`
6. Deploy the service.

Once deployed, open the public URL of your service to finish the Umami setup.

### Notes

- Data is stored in the PostgreSQL addon and persists across deploys.
- You can scale the service or update the image version from the dashboard.
