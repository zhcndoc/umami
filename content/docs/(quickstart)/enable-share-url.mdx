Share URLs make it easy to share your analytics.

By default your website’s metrics are private. When you want to share insights, you can generate a public **Share URL** for specific views.

## What You Can Share

When you create a Share URL, you can choose exactly which views are visible. This gives you full control over what data is shared publicly.
